        <h1>Welcome to the Main Synagogue of Barcelona, the oldest in Sepharad and one of the oldest in Europe.</h1>
        <h3>IN THE FOUNDATIONAL STONE ROOM:</h3>
        <p>It is called the Main Synagogue because it was the largest and most important of the five synagogues in Barcelona. The first question you may be asking is why it is so small if it is called the Main Synagogue... The first reason is that there was a law that did not allow Jews to build a synagogue higher or wider than the smallest church in the town, which forced them to adhere to this rule even if it was the Main Synagogue.</p>
        <p>The second reason is that to this day, we have not been able to recover the entirety of what the original synagogue was. When it was rescued in 1996, these missing spaces already belonged to the adjacent restaurant, and although it is one of the pending projects among many for recovery in the Call (the Jewish quarter), this is a private initiative with limited resources.</p>
        <p>This synagogue was rescued thanks to the efforts and tenacity of Mr. Miguel Iaffa, our founder. He was a Catalan Jew born in a town called Marçá in Tarragona. He was raised in Argentina because his father came to fight against the Nazis as a volunteer in the International Brigades, and they had to leave when the war ended. With the arrival of the military dictatorship in Argentina, Miguel returned to Europe, and after studying Medieval History at the University of La Sorbonne in Paris, he came to Barcelona in the 1970s to explore the neighborhood in search of remnants of Jewish heritage in a time when this neighborhood was marginal and dangerous.</p>
        <p>He found this location, in part, because he was able to confirm an unusual deviation in the main facade, which orients it towards the East, facing Jerusalem, thus complying with one of the rules for building a synagogue, the Kottel Ha’Mizrah.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, thanks to a publication by Historian Jaume Riera, he was able to determine the location through the discovery of a tax collector's book in the archives of the Cathedral, which determined the location of the Synagogue.</p>
        <p>Despite his efforts to recover the synagogue, in 1996 Miguel Iaffa was alerted that the building was being put up for sale and would be acquired to open a bar. That was the turning point for Miguel, who could not allow such a situation and decided to buy the property and begin archaeological work to try to find evidence of what he already knew, that the Main Synagogue of Barcelona had been located here.</p>
        <p>The first significant discovery they found in the excavations were the two basins you can see here, dating from the 15th century and built by Jaume d’Arguens and his family, who settled here in 1477 when this space was no longer used as a synagogue.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;" ><img style="max-height:230px ;" src="pozos nuevos.PNG"> <img style="max-height:230px ;" src="pozos antiguos.PNG"></div>
        <p>By that time, Judaism had already been eradicated in the city, and they stayed on as converts and established their dyer business here. They lived and worked here for 10 years until, in 1487, the Spanish Inquisition accused them of secretly practicing Judaism and condemned them to be burned at the stake. The family escaped to France, but Jaume's mother-in-law failed to escape and was executed. She was the last Jewish presence in this space.</p>
        <p>The second thing they found was the Roman wall, dating from the 3rd - 4th century AD. We can determine the date by the architectural style of the wall, which is Opus Africanum.</p>
        <p>At the base of this wall, the most important discovery of all was made: the foundational stone of the Synagogue was identified.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-height:230px ;" src="Piedra.PNG">        <img style="max-height:230px ;" src="18.jpg"></div>
        <p>If you look at the side, this stone has a Roman numeral chiseled. It is represented with an X, two bars, and another X. This number, written as it was in the 3rd century, is the number XVIII today. (X=10 IIX=8).</p>
        <p>In Kabbalah, XVIII means "Jay," which in Hebrew means life, and who gives us life: Hashem (God). This is why we know that in the 3rd century, this space was a synagogue.</p>
        <h3>WE MOVE TO THE HOLY ARK ROOM (where the Torah is kept)</h3>
        <p>The Jewish community of Barcelona was very large and important in medieval times, and until 1391, it represented between 15-20% of the city's population. They lived in this neighborhood, which was not a ghetto, and they spoke Catalan.</p>
        <p>This was also the synagogue of RASHBAH, an acronym for Salomó Ben Adret, a great Talmudist and Chief Rabbi of Barcelona, who was born and died in Barcelona (1235-1310).</p>
        <p>On August 5, 1391, the neighborhood was attacked and set on fire by a popular uprising: the Pogrom of Barcelona. It was a time of the Black Death and the Inquisition, and the rumor spread that Jews were less affected by the plague than Christians, which could only mean that they were poisoning the water or had the cure and were not sharing it with Christians. This ended in the assault on this neighborhood and this synagogue, in which more than 400 Jews died and more than 3,000 were brutally beaten and forcibly baptized.</p>
        <p>From that moment on, the Jews of Barcelona, who had lived here for generations, had to choose: leave the region or stay converted to Catholicism and repudiated by the rest of the city.</p>
        <p>That rumor was nothing more than an excuse to attack a population that was already despised, and the explanation for their lower infection rate by the plague was simply the hygiene rules and customs that Jews had regarding personal hygiene, which allowed them to avoid the plague to a greater extent than Christians, who often lacked any personal hygiene.</p>
        <p>In 1492, the official expulsion of Jews from Spain was decreed, but by then, there was no one left to expel here. They had been killed, had fled, or had been forcibly converted to Christianity.</p>
        <p>From that moment on, all Jewish property passed into the hands of the king, and after that, the Main Synagogue was donated to one of the king's counselors and rented for various purposes.</p>
        <p>In this room, there is a document on the wall that is a royal authorization. The original is in the archives of the Crown of Aragon in Barcelona. In it, King Jaume I the Conqueror authorizes its partial reconstruction in 1267, as it had fallen well below ground level, and as we have mentioned, Jews needed royal authorization to carry out any work or rehabilitation in a synagogue.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-height: 250px;" src="carta.PNG"></div>
        <p>The ceiling is a typical "volta catalana" built in the 17th century when it was authorized for the property to be divided in two and a building was constructed above the synagogue.</p>
        <h4>In this room, we can also find an important collection of Judaica objects.</h4>
        <p>Special mention deserves the Torah inside the Aron Kodesh, written in the 16th century and donated by a New York family, the Rozenwaig.</p>
        <p>The Torah in the showcase is not kosher as it is missing parts, and it is from the 18th century, found at a flea market in Morocco and donated by a Catalan collector, Joaquim Oller.</p>
        <p>The chest is a bride's dowry that belonged to a Jewish family in Barcelona and is from the 17th century.</p>
        <p>The Menorah (candelabrum) is the work of an artist from Mallorca named Ferrán Aguiló, belonging to one of the fifteen Jewish families still registered in the Cathedral of Mallorca who went through the mandatory Inquisition and conversion. He converted back to Judaism and donated the menorah in memory of his "xueta" ancestors (the name given to Jews in the island of Mallorca).</p>
        <p>The collection of pewter plates is not only from Spain; it is a special donation from Mr. Alex Neish, a non-Jewish Scottish Anglican, who is one of the largest collectors of pewter and wanted to donate them to a place of special significance, donating part of his collection when he learned that the Main Synagogue of Barcelona had been recovered.</p>
        <p>There is also the private collection of the Iaffa Family, which decided to keep it displayed in the Synagogue, including various pieces of Jewish culture.</p>
        <p>The stained glass window is the work of Máximo Iaffa, Miguel Iaffa's brother. The Star of David is composed of the colors of the twelve tribes of Israel. The message: Even broken pieces can be joined together.</p>
        <p>Currently, the Synagogue serves an important role as a center for the dissemination of Jewish culture and history in Sepharad for all visitors, regardless of their religion.</p>
        <p>Miguel Iaffa bought this property in 1996 and managed to recover and reopen the Synagogue in 2002, after 6 years of hard work, dedication, and his own resources.</p>
        <p>In 2016, Miguel passed away, and his children, Saul and Ruth, who helped him in the recovery, continue his legacy and work to continue the recovery of Jewish history and culture in this country.</p>
